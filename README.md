# 8 Week SQL Challenge by Data with Danny
This a repository where I post SQL solution queries from Danny Ma's 8-week SQL challenge.

# Case Study 1 - Danny's Diner.
### Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of my assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but has no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

### Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally, he needs help to generate some essential datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

My Job is to write queries to produce the data needed to answer business questions.

# Case Study 2 - Pizza Runner.
### Introduction
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway…)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### Problem Statement
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimize Pizza Runner’s operations.
My job is to help Danny write queries to help clean his data and perform calculations with SQL

# Case Study 3 - Foodie-Fi.
### Introduction
Subscription-based businesses are super popular and Danny realized that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food-related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data-driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription-style digital data to answer important business questions.
